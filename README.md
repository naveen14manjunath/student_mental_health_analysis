Analyzing the Impact of Length of Stay on Mental Health Scores of International Students.

# Project Overview
This project explores how the length of stay affects the mental health diagnostic scores of international students. By analyzing PHQ-9 [Measures depression severity] (todep), SCS [Measures self-compassion and stress levels] (tosc), and ASISS[Assesses social anxiety and stress indicators] (toas) test scores, we aim to identify trends in mental well-being based on the duration of stay.

# Data Used
**Data** - Students Data with over 300 rows.

**Data Cleaning & Analysis** - PostGreSql Workbench

**Data Visualization** - DataCamp Compiler

# Question
Analyze the impact of length of stay (stay) on the mental health scores of international students by grouping data by stay. Compute the total count of students (count_int), along with the average PHQ-9 (average_phq), SCS (average_scs), and ASISS (average_as) scores, rounded to two decimal places. 

# Findings
The analysis found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
Mental health appears to decline as stay duration increases, with higher PHQ-9 (depression) and ASISS (social anxiety/stress) scores over time as shown in the gragh.
Universities or support programs should focus on long-term international students to provide better mental health resources.
